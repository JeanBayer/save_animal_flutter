# App Save Animals

This App uses the [IUCN Red List API](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/), which gives us a lot of information about animals in danger of extinction, I decided to make the mobile version of [dayan's](https://github.com/dayanMichelle) website, using flutter, the application is very basic and will be constantly renewed

- State management with Provider
- API connection with GET method
- Open browser in webview mode
